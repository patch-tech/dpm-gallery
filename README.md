## Welcome to the Data Package Gallery

This is your resource for quickly exploring and learning about the interesting ways you can use data packages.

Each directory houses a self contained example with a README and a runnable program.

While most of the programs are runnable out of the box, you will be able to do more if you have already set up `dpm`.  <link>
