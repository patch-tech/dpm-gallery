## Welcome to the Data Package Gallery

This is your resource for quickly exploring and learning about the interesting ways you can use data packages.

Each directory houses a self contained example with a README and a runnable program.

It helps if you have already set up `dpm` and created a free account on DPM cloud to publish your packages. <link>
